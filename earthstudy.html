    <h2>Scientific Deep Dive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Geology:</strong> ocean floor is shaped by plate tectonics, featuring diverse landscapes like mid-ocean ridges, trenches, and abyssal plains</li>
      <li><strong>Ecology:</strong> The deep ocean is characterized by high pressure, low temperatures (around 2-4°C), and the lack of sunlight. </li>
      <li><strong>Climate:</strong> The ocean absorbs a vast amount of solar radiation, acting as the largest solar energy collector on Earth. It absorbs approximately 91% of the excess heat in the Earth's climate system. </li>
    </ul>
