* Netflix-CLone: I make a clone of netflix which helps me improve my skills in the field of Front end development. Initially, I'm really bad at handling all the properties in CSS but now, I become proficient in building something on my own through CSS.
  
ASTRO-V: ---------------------------------------------------------->>>>>>>>>
- My first team project "ASTRO-V" a simple learning platform for people who have keen interest in general knowledge and fun facts which is generated with space theme.
- Guess what...!!! This project just built entirely based on the HTML and CSS.
- In this project, each planet has been uniquely paired with real-world environment such as
1. Mercury --> Deserts
2. Venus --> Volcanoes
3. Earth --> Oceans
4. Mars --> Mountains
5. Jupiter --> Cities
6. Saturn --> Forests
7. Uranus --> Glaciers
8. Neptune --> Islands
- I used different types of properties like transform for rotation, grid concept, flex, borders, and many more.
- Let's get dive into the output of the code-->>>>>>>
