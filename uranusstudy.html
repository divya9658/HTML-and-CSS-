    <h2>What is a Glacier?</h2>
    <p>A glacier is a large, slow-moving body of ice that forms on land and is a key part of the Earth's cryosphere.</p>

  <section class="section science">
    <h2>Scientific Deep Dive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Snow accumulates, compacts, and transforms into firn, which eventually turns into glacial ice.</li>
      <li><strong>Glacial Movemen:</strong> Glaciers flow under the influence of gravity, and the rate of movement varies based on temperature, slope, and ice thickness.</li>
      <li><strong>Glacial Erosion:</strong> Glaciers carve valleys, create U-shaped valleys, and deposit sediments as they move.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Earth & Space Comparison</h2>
    <p>While glaciers don't exist on other planets, the concept of ice caps and polar ice sheets is relevant.</p>

    <div class="landmark">
    <p><span style="color:#E0F7FA;">&#10052;</span> <b>Seller Glacier</b> – he Sellar Glacier, a large glacier in the Antarctic Peninsula, is primarily composed of matter in the form of ice and snow.</p>
</div>
    <div class="landmark">
      <p><span style="color:#D6EAF8;">&#129482;</span> <b>Thurston Glacier</b> – Thurston Glacier is glacial ice, a form of water (H₂O) in a solid state. The glacier, like the Antarctic Ice Sheet, is composed of compressed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="landmark">
      <p><span style="color:#EDC9AF;">&#127964;</span> <b>Alexander Island Glacier No. 1</b> – The glacier's interaction with the Bach and Wilkins Ice Shelves is a key area of research.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="landmark">
      <p><span style="color:#60e3f4;">&#127774;</span> <b>Alexander Island Glacier No.2</b> –  The Alexander Island Glacier No. 1 is a glacier, a large body of ice, located on an island in Antarctica.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="landmark">
      <p><span style="color:#A0522D;">&#9968;</span> <b>Baring Glacier</b> – The Bering Glacier is a large glacier found in Alaska. The Bering Glacier is described as a "matter" because it is a large mass of ice, which is a form of matter. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="landmark">
       <p><span style="color:#D2691E;">&#127797;</span> <b>Wykeham Glacier</b> – The glacier is primarily composed of frozen water, specifically ice in the form of glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="landmark">
      <p><span style="color:#A9A9A9;">&#127788;</span> <b>Malaspina-Seward glacier</b> – The Malaspina Glacier is a sensitive indicator of climatic change, and its thickness has been studied through radar and aerial photography.</p>
